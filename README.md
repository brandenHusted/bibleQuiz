How to get the Outreach Christian Church Game Working.

Opening website:

You can do this by double clicking index.html or if you do not have visual studio and can not start up the server to enter your email and password into the database you can just double click game.html to go straight to the game.

downloading Visual Studio Code:

Visual Studio Code is a very useful tool with developing websites. I recommend using a computer not a phone for this step. You can download this here: 
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
(make sure to use Visual Studio Code not Visual Studio 2022)
Then with this done open Visual Studio Code. 
Go to this Page and click on the green button with Code on it. make sure Your on HTTPS and Copy the Url to your clipboard. 

Now go back to Visual Studio Code and decide you want to put this folder. Once you do that type in the terminal
git clone (paste Url).

This will give you all my Code on your machine and you can have everything I had. 

If you want to start the server on my website to test the user log in type
node server.js
This will start the server and you are good to go!

Future plans:

In the future I want to have a button to let a user download a pdf of their scores.
more Questions and add images to the questions as well.
Maybe Facial Recognition support if you have a picture of someone and you want to know their gender and age from Outreach using faceapi.js.
Outreach specific AI chatbot for questions people have and email for questions on how to get involved.
Implementing any feedback you give me!

This app's goal is for people to learn more about Outreach Christian Church and learn how to get involved and who we are in our community. I hope this small step can have a huge impact, have fun!
