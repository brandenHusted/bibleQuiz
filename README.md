Welcome to the Bible Quiz Project! This application is designed to help people learn more about the Bible in a fun and engaging way. Whether you're looking to test your knowledge or learn something new, this quiz is a great place to start.

## Getting Started

### Opening the Website

You can get started by following these steps:

1. **Launch the Website:**
   - Double-click on `index.html` to open the main page.
   - If you don't have Visual Studio or can't start the server, you can skip the login step by directly opening `game.html` to jump straight into the quiz.

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

To modify the project or test the user login, you'll need to set up a development environment.

#### 1. Install Git

Git is essential for version control and collaboration. Follow these steps to install Git:

- **Download Git:**  
  [Download Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)  
  Choose the 64-bit Windows setup installer.

  3. Open Visual Studio Code.
  4. In the terminal, navigate to the folder where you want to save the project, then type:

     ```bash
     git clone <paste URL here>
     ```

  This command will clone the repository to your local machine, giving you access to all the code.
