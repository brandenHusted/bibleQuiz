How to get the Outreach Christian Church Game Working.

Opening website:

You can do this by double clicking index.html or if you do not have visual studio and can not start up the server to enter your email and password into the database you can just double click game.html to go straight to the game.

Download Github onto your computer:
Go here to download Git https://git-scm.com/download/win
Download the 64 bit installer

Go here to download chocolatey. Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows, designed to help you automate the installation, updating, and management of software on your Windows system. 
https://community.chocolatey.org/courses/installation/installing?method=installing-chocolatey#cmd
Go to basic chocolatey install
Use cmd.exe and copy the code
Open your command Prompt on your computer and right click and run as administrator
paste the code and hit enter
When it is finished downloading type
choco install git
github should now be installed on your device
downloading Visual Studio Code:

Visual Studio Code is a very useful tool with developing websites. I recommend using a computer not a phone for this step. You can download this here: 
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
(make sure to use Visual Studio Code not Visual Studio 2022)
Then with this done open Visual Studio Code. 
Go to this Page and click on the green button with Code on it. make sure Your on HTTPS and Copy the Url to your clipboard. 

Now go back to Visual Studio Code and decide where you want to put this folder. Once you do that type in the terminal
git clone (paste Url).

This will give you all my Code on your machine and you can have everything I had. 

If you want to start the server on my website to test the user log in type
node server.js
This will start the server and you are good to go!

Future plans:

In the future I want to have a button to let a user download a pdf of their scores.
more Questions and add images to the questions as well.
Maybe Facial Recognition support if you have a picture of someone and you want to know their gender and age from Outreach using faceapi.js.
Outreach specific AI chatbot for questions people have and email for questions on how to get involved.
Implementing any feedback you give me!

This app's goal is for people to learn more about Outreach Christian Church and learn how to get involved and who we are in our community. I hope this small step can have a huge impact, have fun!
