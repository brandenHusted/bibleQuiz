How to get the Outreach Christian Church Game Working.

step 1: Opening website

You can do this by double clicking index.html or if you do not have visual studio and can not start up the server to enter your email and password into the database you can just double click game.html to go straight to the game.

downloading Visual Studio Code:

Visual Studio Code is a very useful tool with developing websites. I recommend using a computer not a phone for this step. You can download this here: 
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
(make sure to use Visual Studio Code not Visual Studio 2022)
Then with this done open Visual Studio Code.
