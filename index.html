    <h3>Our Mission Statement</h3>
    <div>God can be known, and that is the whole reason we gather to worship him and go out to tell people about him.</div>
    <div>One thing we must be careful to do, is to know God as he defines himself, not as we imagine he should be.</div>
      <div>We do believe some things must be held as essential to understanding and being in relationship with God.</div>
